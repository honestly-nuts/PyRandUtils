### This dipshit of a module is a collection of tools that nobody gives a shit about

like:

    1. a json parser
    2. ???

On a serious note, PyRandUtils is a collection of random tools. What does it have that others don't? nothing, I just made this package for fun because I was bored.
If you want to use it, use it. If you dont want to use it, I dont give a shit. If you think you can improve my code, then do it, or dont this project is going nowhere

NOTE!:::!::::!::
The parser is early early early alpha, I just wrote it this morning, so it has tons of bugs. So if you encounter one, please report it or even fix it if you want to.
